            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>it is no ſtrange matter, if differing repreſentations are often ſeene vpon one and the ſame ſubiect, for beſides the ordinary change in the face of things, it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult really to know how they are but with time. Hitherto you haue had ſuch pourtraitures of this Towne, and of the ſiedge thereof as might be recouered, to content the deſires of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties faithfull ſeruants. But at this preſent hauing with much curioſity, had the care to gather together all the plots and reports which haue bene made thereof, as well by his Maieſties Inginers, as by many Lords and braue Captaines, which (with his Maieſty) haue beene vpon the places, and haue ſeene and conducted the greater part of the workes there ſeene at this preſent; I haue beene perſwaded that you would moſt willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a ſight of this laſt aſſay of it, which I haue grauen ſo exactly and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I haue bene aſſured I might preſent it to his Maieſtie which I haue alſo done, who receiuing it with great contentment, I hope that you will infallibly doe the like.</p>
               <p>For the vnderſtanding then of this onely exact and true new plot; It is to be noted, that diuiding the Circuit of the walles of the Cittie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the foure parts of the world: The part oppoſite to the ſouth, is that which is from the tower of the Farre vnto the gate of Saint <hi>Nicolas,</hi> which is filled by the Sea during the flood; In which time, ſhippes may enter within the ſaid hauen, where they are locked vp by a chaine, which riſeth from the tower of Saint <hi>Nicolas,</hi> and of la <hi>Chaisne:</hi> the entrance of the ſaid hauen, hauing no other bredth then for a great veſſell to enter in. It is alſo to be noted, that vpon the ebbe, as well the hauen as the places where theſe figures 35. are quoted reſt dry, being but owze vpon which it is impoſſible to goe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the ſame walles towards the Eaſt &amp; weſt, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth from S. <hi>Nicolas</hi> gate, vntill drawing neere to the <hi>Congne</hi> gate, is taken vp by a ſalt marſh, where for the moſt part, the water remaineth alwaies a flote, and is therein maintained by meanes of a channell, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked 28. being newly made for the commodity of the ſalt pitts which are in the ſaid Marſh, as alſo to make the water riſe within the ditches by meanes of a Sluce, marked 30.</p>
               <p>The third part of the walles, which are from the Eaſt South-eaſt ſide, is from the <hi>Baſtion</hi> of the <hi>Euangille,</hi> vnto the tower of Farre vpon all this length, there is a little hill which reacheth to the ſea, which hill in ſome ſort commandeth the towne, howſoeuer Its diſtance hindereth that no offence can be giuen, point blanke, neuertheleſſe it may ſerue to take vp the flanckes, and hinder the defences and retrenchments of thoſe of the towne; It is to be noted, that betweene the ſame little hill and the towne, there is a meddow which by certaine ſprings which are in thoſe parts, is kept moyſt the greater part of the yeare.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt part, is that which looketh towards the North, which reacheth from the <hi>Baſtion</hi> of the <hi>Euangille</hi> vnto this ſide of the <hi>Congne</hi> gate, which is firme &amp; grauely earth &amp; much raiſed vp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by means whereof, all manner of acceſſe may bee had to the place by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment, although it be againſt the opinion of many.</p>
               <p>This is ſummarily that which I can tell you of this place, as alſo of the workes there made in Blocking thereof, which I haue obſerued in the beſt I poſſibly could, as well for the plot of the place as of the Country.</p>
